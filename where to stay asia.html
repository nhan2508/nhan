        In planning that big trip to Southeast Asia (SEA) there are a lot of logistical challenges, not the least of
        which is where you will stay. The easy answer might be to book your accommodations in Southeast Asia with
        rewards points through a big chain hotel, with a name you recognize and are confident in, but perhaps you want
        to go a little deeper than that.

        Perhaps you’re interested in a more local stay, one where your dollar spent will more directly benefit the local
        economy. Or, perhaps you’re looking for a more authentic experience in the countries you’re visiting. Maybe you
        just want to experience something very different and stay in the places that local travelers would stay in.

        The good news is that there are lots of options, from posh resorts where you’ll be pampered and relax, to home
        rentals that will allow you to truly “live local.”

      <h3>1.Luxury & Resorts</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12 center-block">
      <img style="width: 1153px; height: 649px;" src="Project/62.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="text-left">
        <br>
        <p>Southeast Asia is a hotspot for luxury resorts and beautiful hotels; particularly if you’re staying near a
          popular travel destination like Phuket, Thailand, or near the beach in Indonesia. There are luxury hotels in
          nearly every main city, and some resorts have gone so far as to claim their own private islands. Most resorts
          come with their own accommodation style, from villas perched precariously on stilts over the clear waters of a
          Vietnamese lagoon, to modern clifftop architecture. Imagine spending your days on the beach, or lounging in an
          infinity pool, and your evenings sampling Southeast Asian culinary delights crafted by your very own personal
          master chef. Ooh la la!

          That said, you’re not going to find too many Marriotts, or Sandals Resorts, lurking around most of Southeast
          Asia. The luxury hotel chains most Western travelers usually rely on are in short supply here and are often
          limited to city centers. If you stay in them, expect to pay the same rates as a luxury hotel chain in Europe,
          or North America. If you’re looking for something truly luxurious in Southeast Asia, give up the idea of
          staying in a chain hotel, and go for something more unique. Local luxury is easy to find here, and you’ll get
          more bang for your buck. Phuket, Thailand has the world’s cheapest luxury resorts.

          Four Seasons: One of the classiest resort chains out there, Four Seasons has 24 locations in SEA, all of them
          stunning. Four Seasons really caters to all types, with resorts in city centers, jungle settings, or on the
          beach.

          Six Senses Ninh Van Bay, Nha Trang: Overlooks the East Vietnam Sea and offers beaches, gardens, and modern
          architecture that incorporates traditional Vietnamese design.

          Pangkor Laut : This absolutely stunning resort is on a private island three miles off the West Coast of
          Malaysia. Sea villas stand on stilts in the bay, with other accommodation including beach, garden, and
          hillside villas.

          La Residence Phou Vao, Luang Prabang: Located in Laos and designed in a traditional style, this hotel is
          famous for its accommodations and spa.

          Amandari, Bali: Near the popular expat town of Ubud, Amandari is a classic Southeast Asian resort, complete
          with tropical gardens, infinity pools galore, and cultural events.

          Alila Uluwatu, Bali: This resort has an unusual, artsy vibe. Set on limestone cliffs sweeping down to a
          perfect beach on the ocean, it’s famous for its food and views.

          Novotel: A go-to for hotels in general. Novotel has a long list of hotels to suit most price ranges. Keep in
          mind that Novotel hotels are generally found only in big cities, in this case: Bangkok, Singapore, Bali, and
          Jakarta.

          Alila: Most of the Alila hotels are located in Bali. All are luxury, unique hotels with an emphasis on modern
          architecture and natural scenery.

          Aman: With luxury hotels in Indonesia, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines, Aman has luxury
          resorts in SEA pretty much covered.</p>

      <h3>2. Hotels Under $150</h3>
    </div>

    <div class="col-md-12 center-block">
      <img style="width: 1153px; height: 649px;" src="Project/63.jpg" alt="">

      <div class="text-left">
        <br>
        <p>Hotels in SEA under $150 are very easy to find. When I was there, I used Agoda to book most of my hotel stays
          and often had beautiful rooms for less than $30 USD a night. It is also perfectly doable to find a room upon
          arrival without much prior planning in most places. Plan according to where you’re headed, and when. For
          example, finding a room is simple during the off-season, or when traveling off the beaten track. Headed to
          Phuket in tourist season? Book way ahead of time if you want to get a good deal. Tourist season makes prior
          planning essential, especially if you’re staying in, or near, a tourist hotspot, or on the coast.

          Keep in mind that some countries are going to be less expensive than others. Vietnam is the ideal destination
          for the budget traveler, while Singapore is famous for being pricey. Check the average room prices ahead of
          time for a good estimate of how much cash you’ll be dishing out.

          Tips for saving money on a hotel in SEA:

          Contact the local tourist board before you arrive to check for the best local budget hotels – some may not be
          listed online.
          Trust that there will be available rooms. Unless you’re traveling in a popular area during tourist season,
          there WILL be something available. If you’re willing to wing it, you may save on booking fees and find special
          deals.
          Stay away from Western hotels. Look for locally run businesses, and you’ll find local prices to match.
          Choose accommodation further away from festivals or big events.
          Adjust your expectations. What do you really need from a hotel? You’ll save money by doing without fine dining
          and a pool.
          Keep an eye out for hotel deals on the following sites:

          Travelfish: One of the single most useful websites for finding SEA accommodation, Travelfish is an independent
          travel guide that focuses specifically on SEA. Use it to find hotels, restaurants, tours, and top
          destinations. Great for finding off-the-beaten-path adventures.

          Agoda: Plug in your destination and dates here for a comprehensive list of available hotels and the sorts of
          rooms they have available. The ratings and recommendations feature of this site is specific to various types
          of travelers, so you’ll find ratings based on business travel, family travel, romantic travel and more. This
          is super helpful in choosing a hotel that will be a good fit. Agoda is also good for last minute planning, as
          well as reservations in advance. I’ve been known to sit in the lobby of a hotel, after being quoted one price
          at the desk, and find a better deal at the same hotel through Agoda, book it online, and check in with a
          smile.

          Expedia: Reliable service when looking for the comfort you’re used to, but won’t always give you the best
          deal. Check your prices against another booking agent, if getting the lowest price is important to you.

          Travelocity: A personal favorite no matter where I’m traveling. Travelocity brings up over 200 hotels in
          Thailand alone, and is one of the only travel sites to bring up hotel options for Burma and Brunei.

          Hotels.com: Hotels has you covered, no matter where you’re going. Similar to Agoda, Hotels is one of the best
          ways to find budget hotels all over Southeast Asia, in even the most remote locations.

      <h3>3. Boutique Hotels</h3>
    </div>

        <p>A boutique hotel is any small hotel with under 100 rooms. By that definition, you’re going to be able to
          find a “boutique” hotel in nearly any town in SEA. Personally, I believe that a boutique hotel needs to have a
          certain measure of style and uniqueness before it’s earned its title.

          SEA spawns your average cheap hotel by the thousands, but finding a truly unique small hotel here can be a
          challenge. Unlike in most other destinations around the world, SEA boutique hotels generally cost a good deal
          more than an average hotel stay, some even bordering on outright luxury prices. If you find the hotel of your
          dreams, it may be worth it. However, after a bit of digging, I’ve found a few great boutique hotels that won’t
          break the bank.

          iescape: The best site out there for finding the perfect boutique hotel, in my opinion. The hotels it
          recommends for Thailand and Indonesia are especially stunning.

          Mr & Mrs Smith: A boutique hotel finder built for honeymooning couples, but perfectly usable for the average
          traveler. Stunning boutique hotels in Cambodia. Pricing on this site is often very high.

          Samar Villa and Spa Resort, Siem Reap, Cambodia: Near the ruins of Angkor Wat, this resort is priced at under
          $100 USD for the off season, which makes it a great deal for a SEA boutique resort.

          Sireeampan Boutique Resort and Spa, Chiang Mai, Thailand: Considered one of the top ten boutique resorts in
          Asia, Sireeampan was originally built as a place for family and friends of a Thai real estate developer to
          relax and vacation together.

          Sekeping Hotel, Serendah, Malaysia: Not far from Kuala Lumpur, this minimalist boutique hotel is a simple, but
          beautiful, forest retreat.

          Manta Dive, Gili Air, Indonesia: Stay in beach bungalows during the night, dive and snorkel during the day,
          starting from $70 USD.
